fix:
- Fix table vis fields order not the same as fields order in the query ([#10754](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/pull/10754))
- Table vis pagination not working due to unnecessary rerendering ([#10754](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/pull/10754))
- Change the default table column alignment to left ([#10754](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/pull/10754))
