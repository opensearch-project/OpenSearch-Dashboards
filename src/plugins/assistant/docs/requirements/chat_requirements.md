# Chat Component Requirements

## Overview
A custom chat component that connects to a LangGraph agent using ag-ui for observability use cases, with advanced context-aware capabilities and universal accessibility.

## Context Architecture Overview

The chat system implements a sophisticated multi-layered context architecture that balances AI efficiency with comprehensive data availability:

### Key Principles
1. **Minimal Automatic Context**: Prevents overwhelming the AI with unnecessary data while ensuring critical information is always available
2. **Rich Optional Context**: Empowers users to selectively add comprehensive context through @ mentions when deeper analysis is needed
3. **Dynamic Adaptation**: Context automatically adjusts based on page state, user actions, and search modes
4. **Persistent Context**: User-selected contexts can be pinned to persist across navigation
5. **Priority-Based Discovery**: Page-specific contexts appear first in suggestions for immediate relevance

### Benefits
- **AI Efficiency**: Automatic context kept minimal (~1KB) to maintain fast response times
- **User Control**: Users decide what additional context to include based on their needs
- **Contextual Relevance**: Dynamic loading ensures context matches current user activity
- **Seamless Integration**: Pages integrate via simple hook pattern with standardized methods
- **Visual Clarity**: Context pills provide clear visibility of active contexts with management controls

#### Context Architecture

##### Context Layers
**User Story:** As a user, I want the chat assistant to have access to relevant page information without overwhelming it with data, while still being able to add comprehensive context when needed.

**Context Types:**
1. **Automatic Context (Minimal Footprint)**
   - Always included in chat conversations
   - Minimal data to avoid overwhelming the AI
   - Contains critical information for immediate awareness
   - Example: Dashboard overview, critical alerts, current search query

2. **Optional Context (Rich Data via @ Mentions)**
   - Available through @ mention system
   - Comprehensive data sets for deeper analysis
   - User-controlled inclusion for specific needs
   - Example: Full metrics, application health details, business KPIs

3. **Dynamic Context (State-Based)**
   - Automatically adjusts based on page state
   - Conditional inclusion based on user actions
   - Example: Search-mode specific widgets appear only during search

4. **Pinned Context (Persistent)**
   - User-selected contexts that persist across pages
   - Survives navigation and page refreshes
   - Stored in localStorage for session continuity

##### Context Priority System
**User Story:** As a user, I want page-specific context to appear first in my @ suggestions so I can quickly access the most relevant information for my current view.

**Priority Requirements:**
- Context items have a `priority` field (lower number = higher priority)
- Page context assigned `priority: 1` to appear first
- Suggestions sorted by priority before category grouping
- Ensures most relevant contexts are immediately visible

##### Context Categories
**User Story:** As a user, I want context suggestions organized by category so I can quickly find the type of information I need.

**Categories:**
- **Page Information**: Page context offered by a page and navigation state. e.g. discover table results
- **Index patterns**: Recently accessed index patterns
- **Saved objects**: Other saved obejcts (last 5 based on the search criteria)

#### @ Hotkey Resource Reference
**User Story:** As a user, I want to use @ mentions to add specific context to my chat conversations for more informed assistance.

**Accessible Resources:**
- Page-specific context with priority ordering
- Dashboard visualizations (individual or groups)
- Time ranges and date filters
- Saved queries and search patterns
- Datasets and data sources
- MCP server resources

**Selection Behavior:**
- @ key triggers dropdown with categorized suggestions
- Priority-based ordering ensures relevance
- Visual icons for quick type identification
- Descriptive tooltips for context understanding
- Keyboard navigation with arrow keys
- Enter to select, Escape to cancel

#### Context Pills Display
**User Story:** As a user, I want to see my active contexts clearly displayed so I understand what information the assistant has access to.

**Display Requirements:**
- Active contexts shown as colored pills above chat input
- Each pill shows icon, title, and action buttons
- Pin/unpin toggle for persistence control
- Remove button for context removal
- Color coding by context type for visual clarity
- Truncated titles with full description on hover
- "Show more" expandable when many contexts active
- Clear all button for bulk removal (excluding pinned)

#### Slash Commands
- `/investigate <optional info>` - Trigger investigation workflows
- Extensible for additional commands

#### Suggestion Positioning Requirements
**User Story:** As a user, I want suggestions to always be visible and accessible when I trigger them, regardless of the chat layout or available space.

**Positioning Behavior:**
- **Smart Positioning**: Suggestions must automatically position themselves to remain fully visible within the viewport
- **Above-Input Display**: In constrained layouts (such as side panels or compact views), suggestions should appear above the input field to ensure visibility
- **Consistent Accessibility**: Suggestions must never appear outside the visible area or be cut off by container boundaries
- **Boundary Awareness**: The suggestion dropdown must detect available space and adjust its position accordingly

**Accessibility Requirements:**
- All suggestions must be reachable via keyboard navigation
- Suggestions must remain within the scrollable area of their container
- In side panel mode with limited vertical space, suggestions must prioritize visibility over standard positioning
- The suggestion dropdown must not cause layout shifts that would move the input field out of view

**Consistency Requirements:**
- Positioning behavior must be consistent across all chat modes (side panel, full page, inline)
- Both @ context suggestions and / command suggestions must follow the same positioning rules
- The selected suggestion must always be visible within the dropdown's scroll area

### 5. Conversation Management
- **Multiple Conversations**: Users can create and manage multiple conversation threads
- **Conversation History**: All conversations are automatically saved and can be accessed later
- **Conversation Switching**: Users can easily switch between different conversations
- **Conversation Metadata**: Each conversation shows title, message count, and last activity date
- **New Chat Creation**: Users can start new conversations at any time with a dedicated button
- **Cross-mode Access**: Same conversations are available in both side panel and full page modes

### 6. Universal Accessibility

#### Multiple Usage Modes
1. **Full Page Chat App** - Dedicated chat interface with multi-turn conversation
2. **Side Panel** - Collapsible panel on any page with multi-turn conversation
