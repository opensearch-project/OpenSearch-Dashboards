# Expressions Plugin Design

## Overview

The Expressions plugin provides a flexible and extensible system for creating, manipulating, and rendering data transformations and visualizations in OpenSearch Dashboards. This document outlines the high-level architecture and key components of the plugin.

## Architecture

The Expressions plugin is built around a core set of components that work together to parse, execute, and render expressions.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Expression String] --> B[Parser]
    B --> C[AST]
    C --> D[Executor]
    D --> E[Function Registry]
    D --> F[Type Registry]
    D --> G[Renderer Registry]
    D --> H[Execution Context]
    H --> I[Inspector Adapters]
    D --> J[Result/Rendered Output]
```

### Key Components

1. **Parser**: Converts expression strings into Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs).
2. **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)**: Represents the structure of an expression.
3. **Executor**: Manages the execution of expressions.
4. **Function Registry**: Stores and manages registered expression functions.
5. **Type Registry**: Manages data types used in expressions.
6. **Renderer Registry**: Stores renderers for visualizing expression outputs.
7. **Execution Context**: Provides shared state and utilities during execution.
8. **Inspector Adapters**: Collect debugging information during execution.

## Execution Flow

The execution of an expression follows these steps:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Client
    participant ExpressionsService
    participant Parser
    participant Executor
    participant FunctionRegistry
    participant TypeRegistry
    participant RendererRegistry

    Client->>ExpressionsService: Execute Expression
    ExpressionsService->>Parser: Parse Expression
    Parser-->>ExpressionsService: Return AST
    ExpressionsService->>Executor: Execute AST
    loop For each function in AST
        Executor->>FunctionRegistry: Get Function
        FunctionRegistry-->>Executor: Return Function
        Executor->>TypeRegistry: Type Check/Cast
        TypeRegistry-->>Executor: Typed Data
        Executor->>Executor: Execute Function
    end
    Executor->>RendererRegistry: Get Renderer
    RendererRegistry-->>Executor: Return Renderer
    Executor->>Executor: Render Result
    Executor-->>ExpressionsService: Return Result
    ExpressionsService-->>Client: Return Result/Rendered Output
```

## Data Flow

The data flow through an expression chain:

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Input] --> B[Function 1]
    B --> C[Function 2]
    C --> D[Function 3]
    D --> E[Renderer]
    E --> F[Output]
```

## Extension Points

The Expressions plugin is designed to be extensible. Key extension points include:

1. **Custom Functions**: Developers can create and register new functions.
2. **Custom Types**: New data types can be added to the type system.
3. **Custom Renderers**: New renderers can be created for custom visualizations.
4. **Inspector Adapters**: Custom adapters can be added for specialized debugging.
