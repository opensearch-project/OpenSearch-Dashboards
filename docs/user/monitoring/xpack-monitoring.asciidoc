= Stack Monitoring

[partintro]
--

The {osd} {monitor-features} serve two separate purposes:

. To visualize monitoring data from across the {stack}. You can view health and 
performance data for {opensearch}, {ls}, and Beats in real time, as well as analyze past 
performance. 
. To monitor {osd} itself and route that data to the monitoring cluster.

If you enable monitoring across the {stack}, each {opensearch} node, {ls} node, {osd} 
instance, and Beat is considered unique based on its persistent
UUID, which is written to the <<settings,`path.data`>> directory when the node
or instance starts. 

NOTE: Watcher must be enabled to view cluster alerts. If you have a Basic
license, Top Cluster Alerts are not displayed.

For more information, see <<configuring-monitoring>> and 
{ref}/monitor-opensearch-cluster.html[Monitor a cluster].
