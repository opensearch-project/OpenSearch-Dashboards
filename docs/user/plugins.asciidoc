[[opensearch-dashboards-plugins]]
= {osd} plugins

Implement add-on functionality for {osd} with plug-in modules.

[IMPORTANT]
.Plugin compatibility
==============================================

The {osd} plugin interfaces are in a state of constant development.  We cannot provide backwards compatibility for plugins due to the high rate of change.  {osd} enforces that the installed plugins match the version of {osd}.  
Plugin developers must release a new version of their plugin for each new {osd} release.

==============================================

[[known-opensearch-dashboards-plugins]]
== Known plugins

The known plugins were tested for {osd} *5.x*, so we are unable to guarantee compatibility with your version of {osd}. The {osd} installer rejects any plugins that haven't been published for your specific version of {osd}. 
We are unable to evaluate or maintain the known plugins, so care should be taken before installation.

NOTE: To add your plugin to this page, open a {osd-repo}tree/{branch}/docs/plugins/known-plugins.asciidoc[pull request].

[float]
[[install-plugin]]
== Install plugins

Use the following command to install a plugin:

[source,shell]
bin/opensearch-dashboards-plugin install <package name or URL>

When you specify a plugin name without a URL, the plugin tool attempts to download an official Elastic plugin, such as:

["source","shell",subs="attributes"]
$ bin/opensearch-dashboards-plugin install x-pack

[float]
[[install-plugin-url]]
=== Install plugins from an arbitrary URL

You can download official Elastic plugins simply by specifying their name. You
can alternatively specify a URL or file path to a specific plugin, as in the following
examples:

["source","shell",subs="attributes"]
$ bin/opensearch-dashboards-plugin install https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/packs/x-pack/x-pack-{version}.zip

or

["source","shell",subs="attributes"]
$ bin/opensearch-dashboards-plugin install file:///local/path/to/custom_plugin.zip

You can specify URLs that use the HTTP, HTTPS, or `file` protocols.

[float]
[[install-plugin-proxy-support]]
=== Proxy support for plugin installation

{osd} supports plugin installation via a proxy. It uses the `http_proxy` and `https_proxy`
environment variables to detect a proxy for HTTP and HTTPS URLs.

It also respects the `no_proxy` environment variable to exclude specific URLs from proxying.

You can specify the environment variable directly when installing plugins:

[source,shell]
$ http_proxy="http://proxy.local:4242" bin/opensearch-dashboards-plugin install <package name or URL>

[float]
[[update-remove-plugin]]
== Update and remove plugins

To update a plugin, remove the current version and reinstall the plugin.

To remove a plugin, use the `remove` command, as in the following example:

[source,shell]
$ bin/opensearch-dashboards-plugin remove x-pack

You can also remove a plugin manually by deleting the plugin's subdirectory under the `plugins/` directory.

NOTE: Removing a plugin will result in an "optimize" run which will delay the next start of {osd}.

[float]
[[disable-plugin]]
== Disable plugins

Use the following command to disable a plugin:

[source,shell]
-----------
./bin/opensearch-dashboards --<plugin ID>.enabled=false <1>
-----------

NOTE: Disabling or enabling a plugin will result in an "optimize" run which will delay the start of {osd}.

<1> You can find a plugin's plugin ID as the value of the `name` property in the plugin's `package.json` file.

[float]
[[configure-plugin-manager]]
== Configure the plugin manager

By default, the plugin manager provides you with feedback on the status of the activity you've asked the plugin manager
to perform. You can control the level of feedback for the `install` and `remove` commands with the `--quiet` and
`--silent` options. Use the `--quiet` option to suppress all non-error output. Use the `--silent` option to suppress all
output.

By default, plugin manager installation requests do not time out. Use the `--timeout` option, followed by a time, to
change this behavior, as in the following examples:

[source,shell]
.Waits for 30 seconds before failing
bin/opensearch-dashboards-plugin install --timeout 30s sample-plugin

[source,shell]
.Waits for 1 minute before failing
bin/opensearch-dashboards-plugin install --timeout 1m sample-plugin

[float]
[[plugin-custom-configuration]]
=== Plugins and custom {osd} configurations

Use the `-c` or `--config` options with the `install` and `remove` commands to specify the path to the configuration file
used to start {osd}. By default, {osd} uses the configuration file `config/opensearch_dashboards.yml`. When you change your installed
plugins, the `bin/opensearch-dashboards-plugin` command restarts the {osd} server. When you are using a customized configuration file,
you must specify the path to that configuration file each time you use the `bin/opensearch-dashboards-plugin` command.

[float]
[[plugin-manager-exit-codes]]
=== Plugin manager exit codes

64:: Unknown command or incorrect option parameter
74:: I/O error
70:: Other error
