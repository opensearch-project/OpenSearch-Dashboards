[[using-api]]
== Using the APIs

Interact with the {osd} APIs through the `curl` command and HTTP and HTTPs protocols.

It is recommended that you use HTTPs on port 5601 because it is more secure.

NOTE: The {osd} Console supports only OpenSearch APIs. You are unable to interact with the {osd} APIs with the Console and must use `curl` or another HTTP tool instead. For more information, refer to <<console-opensearch-dashboards,Console>>.

[[api-authentication]]
=== Authentication

The {osd} APIs support key- and token-based authentication. 

[float]
[[token-api-authentication]]
==== Token-based authentication

To use token-based authentication, you use the same username and password that you use to log into Elastic.  
In a given HTTP tool, and when available, you can select to use its 'Basic Authentication' option, 
which is where the username and password are stored in order to be passed as part of the call. 

[float]
[[key-authentication]]
==== Key-based authentication

To use key-based authentication, you create an API key using the Elastic Console, then specify the key in the header of your API calls.

For information about API keys, refer to <<api-keys,API keys>>.

[float]
[[api-calls]]
=== API calls
API calls are stateless. Each request that you make happens in isolation from other calls and must include all of the necessary information for {osd} to fulfill the request. API requests return JSON output, which is a format that is machine-readable and works well for automation.

Calls to the API endpoints require different operations. To interact with the {osd} APIs, use the following operations:

* *GET* - Fetches the information.

* *POST* - Adds new information.

* *PUT* - Updates the existing information.

* *DELETE* - Removes the information.

For example, the following `curl` command exports a dashboard:

[source,sh]
--
curl -X POST api/opensearch-dashboards/dashboards/export?dashboard=942dcef0-b2cd-11e8-ad8e-85441f0c2e5c
--
// OPENSEARCH_DASHBOARDS

[float]
[[api-request-headers]]
=== Request headers

For all APIs, you must use a request header. The {osd} APIs support the `osd-xsrf` and `Content-Type` headers.

`osd-xsrf: true`::
  By default, you must use `osd-xsrf` for all API calls, except in the following scenarios:

* The API endpoint uses the `GET` or `HEAD` operations
* The path is whitelisted using the <<settings-xsrf-whitelist, `server.xsrf.whitelist`>> setting
* XSRF protections are disabled using the <<settings-xsrf-disableProtection, `server.xsrf.disableProtection`>> setting

`Content-Type: application/json`::
  Applicable only when you send a payload in the API request. {osd} API requests and responses use JSON. Typically, if you include the `osd-xsrf` header, you must also include the `Content-Type` header.

Request header example:

[source,sh]
--
curl -X POST \
  http://localhost:5601/api/spaces/space \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'osd-xsrf: true' \
  -d '{
	"id": "sales",
	"name": "Sales",
	"description": "This is your Sales Space!",
	"disabledFeatures": []
}
'
