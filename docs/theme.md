# Theme System

## Basic concepts

### Theme definitions in OUI

Themes are defined in OUI via https://github.com/opensearch-project/oui/blob/main/src/themes/themes.ts. When Building OUI, there are several theming artifacts generated (beyond the react components) for each mode (light/dark) of each theme:

1. Theme compiled stylesheets (e.g. `@elastic/eui/dist/eui_theme_dark.css`). Consumed as entry files in [/packages/osd-ui-shared-deps/webpack.config.js](/packages/osd-ui-shared-deps/webpack.config.js) and republished by `osd-ui-shared-deps` (e.g. [UiSharedDeps.darkCssDistFilename](/packages/osd-ui-shared-deps/index.js)).
2. Theme compiled and minified stylesheets (e.g. `@elastic/eui/dist/eui_theme_dark.min.css`). These appear unused by OpenSearch Dashboards
3. Theme computed SASS variables as JSON (e.g. `@elastic/eui/dist/eui_theme_dark.json`). Consumed by [/packages/osd-ui-shared-deps/theme.ts](/packages/osd-ui-shared-deps/theme.ts) and made available to other components via the mode and theme aware `euiThemeVars`. In general, these should not be consumed by any other component directly.
4. Theme type definition file for SASS variables as JSON (e.g. `@elastic/eui/dist/eui_theme_dark.json.d.ts`)

Note that all of these artifacts should ideally only be imported or used directly in one place (by `osd-ui-shared-deps`).

In addition to these artifacts, OpenSearch Dashboards also makes heavy use of the theme SASS variables and mixins as defined in the source files (e.g. `@elastic/eui/src/theme_dark.scss`).

### Theme definitions in OpenSearch Dashboards

1. Theme tags are defined in [/packages/osd-optimizer/src/common/theme_tags.ts](/packages/osd-optimizer/src/common/theme_tags.ts) corresponding to each mode (light/dark) of each OUI theme.
2. These tags must correspond to entrypoint SCSS files in [/src/core/public/core_app/styles/](/src/core/public/core_app/styles/_globals_v8dark.scss), because they are imported by all SCSS files as part of the `sass-loader` in [/packages/osd-optimizer/src/worker/webpack.config.ts](/packages/osd-optimizer/src/worker/webpack.config.ts) and [/packages/osd-optimizer/src/worker/theme_loader.ts](/packages/osd-optimizer/src/worker/theme_loader.ts). Note that the optimizer webpack will compile a separate stylesheet for each unique mode and theme combination.
3. OUI SCSS source files are also imported by `osd-ui-framework`, which generates the legacy KUI stylesheets (e.g. [/packages/osd-ui-framework/src/kui_next_dark.scss](/packages/osd-ui-framework/src/kui_next_dark.scss)). KUI is a UI library that predates EUI/OUI, and should be deprecated and fully removed via [#1060](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/issues/1060). Because it's a legacy package it has its own build process that doesn't use webpack; it just [compiles the SCSS files with grunt](/packages/osd-ui-framework/Gruntfile.js). But similarly to 2., a separate stylesheet is generated for each mode and theme combination.

### Thmemed assets in OpenSearch Dasboards

In general, most themed assests can be found in [/src/core/server/core_app/assets](src/core/server/core_app/assets/fonts/readme.md) (it also includes non-themed assets such as `favicons`, which could easily be themed if desired in the future).

Most of the graphics/images are only dark/light mode-specific, not theme-specific:

1. `default_branding` marks
2. `logos`

This directory also includes legacy CSS files ([/src/core/server/core_app/assets/legacy_dark_theme.css](/src/core/server/core_app/assets/legacy_dark_theme.css) and [/src/core/server/core_app/assets/legacy_light_theme.css](/src/core/server/core_app/assets/legacy_light_theme.css)), which predate even KUI, and are still used by some plugins (notably `discover`). See [#4385](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/pull/4385) for an experiment in removing these. Unlike KUI, they don't rely on OUI themes at all.

Finally, font assets are a bit of a special case. Theme-specific fonts are defined by OUI, but it doesn't include the font definitions directly. Instead, the font assets are in [/src/core/server/core_app/assets/fonts](/src/core/server/core_app/assets/fonts/readme.md). The corresponding `@font-face` style definitions are generated at runtime via [/src/core/server/rendering/views/fonts.tsx](/src/core/server/rendering/views/fonts.tsx).

### Loading

`src/legacy/ui/ui_render/ui_render_mixin.js` via `src/legacy/ui/ui_render/bootstrap/template.js.hbs` and `src/legacy/ui/ui_render/bootstrap/app_bootstrap.js`. Aliased in `src/legacy/ui/ui_mixin.js`, called by `src/legacy/server/osd_server.js`. Called by `src/core/server/legacy/legacy_service.ts` via `src/core/server/server.ts`

### Injected style tags

1. `src/core/server/rendering/views/styles.tsx` - depends on dark/light mode and injects style tag in head
2. `src/core/server/rendering/views/fonts.tsx` - depends on theme version and injects font style tag in head
3. Monaco editor styles
4. Ace styles
5. Ace TM overrides
6. Ace error styles
6. Component styles

### Styleshsheets loaded

Each of the following are loaded in the browser by the [bootstrap script](/src/legacy/ui/ui_render/bootstrap/template.js.hbs) in this order. Currently, these are never unloaded.

1. Monaco editor styles (e.g. [/packages/osd-ui-shared-deps/target/osd-ui-shared-deps.css](/packages/osd-ui-shared-deps/target/osd-ui-shared-deps.css)), packaged by [/packages/osd-ui-shared-deps/webpack.config.js](/packages/osd-ui-shared-deps/webpack.config.js). In theory, this file could include styles from other shared dependencies, but currently `osd-monaco` is the only package that exports styles. Note that these are the default, un-themed styles; theming of monaco editors is handled by [/src/plugins/opensearch_dashboards_react/public/code_editor/editor_theme.ts](/src/plugins/opensearch_dashboards_react/public/code_editor/editor_theme.ts).
2. Theme and mode-specific OUI styles (e.g. [](), compiled by `packages/osd-ui-shared-deps/webpack.config.js`).
3. Theme and mode-specific KUI styles (e.g. `packages/osd-ui-framework/src/kui_next_dark.scss`, compiled by `packages/osd-ui-framework/Gruntfile.js`). Separate stylesheets for each theme version/dark mode combo (colors).
4. Mode-specific legacy styles (e.g. [/src/core/server/core_app/assets/legacy_dark_theme.css](/src/core/server/core_app/assets/legacy_dark_theme.css))

Component styles are not loaded as stylesheets.
