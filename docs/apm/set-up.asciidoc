APM is available via the navigation sidebar in {Osd}.
If you have not already installed and configured Elastic APM,
the *Setup Instructions* in OpenSearchDashboards will get you started.

=== Load the index pattern

Index patterns tell OpenSearchDashboards which OpenSearch indices you want to explore.
An APM index pattern is necessary for certain features in the APM app, like the query bar.
To set up the correct index pattern,
simply click *Load OpenSearchDashboards objects* at the bottom of the Setup Instructions.

TIP: To use a custom index pattern,
adjust OpenSearchDashboards's <<apm-settings-in-opensearch-dashboards,settings>> or use the <<api-create-apm-index-pattern,OpenSearchDashboards API>>.
