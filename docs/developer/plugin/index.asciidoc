== External plugin development

[IMPORTANT]
==============================================
The {osd} plugin interfaces are in a state of constant development.  We cannot provide backwards compatibility for plugins due to the high rate of change.  {osd} enforces that the installed plugins match the version of {osd} itself.  Plugin developers will have to release a new version of their plugin for each new {osd} release as a result.
==============================================

Most developers who contribute code directly to the {osd} repo are writing code inside plugins, so our <<contributing>> docs are the best place to
start. However, there are a few differences when developing plugins outside the {osd} repo. These differences are covered here.
