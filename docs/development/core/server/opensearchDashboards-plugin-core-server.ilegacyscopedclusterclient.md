Serves the same purpose as "normal" `ClusterClient` but exposes additional `callAsCurrentUser` method that doesn't use credentials of the OpenSearchDashboards internal user (as `callAsInternalUser` does) to request OpenSearch API, but rather passes HTTP headers extracted from the current user request to the API.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export declare type ILegacyScopedClusterClient = Pick<LegacyScopedClusterClient, 'callAsCurrentUser' | 'callAsInternalUser'>;
```
