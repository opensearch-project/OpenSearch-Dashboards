Operations::
* OpenSearchDashboards no longer needs to optimize plugins for use in the browser when a plugin is installed. This means the --optimize flag is now deprecated and does nothing now. It will be removed in 8.0 {opensearch-dashboards-pull}73154[#73154]
* Docker containers now use CentOS 8.2 as the base image, upgrading from 7. {opensearch-dashboards-pull}74656[#74656]
* Docker images now include CJK fonts built in {opensearch-dashboards-pull}74806[#74806]

* The deprecated Dashboard Import API (POST /api/opensearch-dashboards/dashboards/import) now accepts filesizes up to the savedObjects.maxImportPayloadBytes configuration
which is 10MB by default {opensearch-dashboards-pull}77409[#77409]
Reporting::
* Reporting configuration settings for time duration values allow "time unit" strings to be specified as well as number of milliseconds.
For byte size values, "byte size" strings are allowed as well as number of bytes. See the Reporting configuration documentation for more details {opensearch-dashboards-pull}74202[#74202]
* Reporting/diagnostics {opensearch-dashboards-pull}74314[#74314]
* Removes the light gray border around the image in PDF reports {opensearch-dashboards-pull}78036[#78036]

Security::
* Hides management sections based on cluster/index privileges {opensearch-dashboards-pull}67791[#67791]
* xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.encryptionKey can now be rotated without losing access to existing encrypted Saved Objects (alerts, actions etc.).
Old key(s) can be moved to xpack.encryptedSavedObjects.keyRotation.decryptionOnlyKeys to be used only to decrypt existing objects while new or updated objects will be encrypted using new primary encryption key.
Administrators can also use dedicated API endpoint /api/encrypted_saved_objects/_rotate_key to trigger re-encryption of all existing objects with a new primary key so that old keys can be safely disposed {opensearch-dashboards-pull}72420[#72420]

* [Detections] Handle conflicts on alert status update {opensearch-dashboards-pull}75492[#75492]
* Improves the experience when OpenSearchDashboards returns a 403 HTTP status code or the user tries to access a page/app they do not have access to. In those instances, a new user-friendly error page is shown.
The user will get the option to go back to the page from where they came, or log in as a different user. Previously the user would just see a simple JSON document containing a short error message
without the ability to do anything {opensearch-dashboards-pull}75538[#75538]
* Adds EQL search strategy {opensearch-dashboards-pull}78645[#78645]
* Fetches related events from the server {opensearch-dashboards-pull}78780[#78780]
* [Resolver] Requests data from new event api {opensearch-dashboards-pull}78782[#78782]
* Updates copy styling {opensearch-dashboards-pull}79313[#79313]
* Excludes cloud alias index from our query {opensearch-dashboards-pull}81551[#81551]
* Implements server-side sessions. {osd} now stores user session information in a dedicated {opensearch} index.
By default, expired and invalid sessions are cleaned from the index every hour.
You can configure the cleanup interval with the `xpack.security.session.cleanupInterval` setting.
After the upgrade, all existing sessions are invalid and users must log back in to {osd}.
It's also no longer possible
to host different {osd} tenants on different ports of the same host.
Although this setup worked in the past, it was discouraged because browsers
share cookies across all applications hosted using the same host name, ignoring ports.
Cookies are now strictly tied to a particular tenant. {opensearch-dashboards-pull}68117[#68117]

* In some old TSVB visualization saved objects, queries and filters can be stored. This is not possible anymore for a while and there is no way to edit them besides changing the JSON of the saved object,
but they were still applied to the rendered output. In 7.10, these leftover queries and filters will be removed automatically from the saved object. In almost all cases, no change is necessary.
If a visualization contained these local queries and filters deliberately, they should be converted to panel filters in the "Panel options" of the TSVB interface {opensearch-dashboards-pull}75137[#75137]

Security::
* Displays useful error when role creation fails {opensearch-dashboards-pull}77600[#77600]
* Previously when user started SAML or OpenID authentication handshake, but didn't or couldn't finish it they weren't able to access Login Selector easily (e.g. to log in with another
authentication provider) unless they used /login URL directly or manually cleared the session cookies. That was a very confusing user experience.
The reason was that unauthenticated intermediate session that was created to support handshake forced OpenSearchDashboards to automatically restart the same handshake whenever user accessed OpenSearchDashboards.
We fixed that and now in certain cases we ignore unauthenticated intermediate session allowing user to easily access Login Selector whenever they need it {opensearch-dashboards-pull}79300[#79300]

=== Security updates
* In {osd} 7.8.1 and earlier, there is a denial of service (DoS) flaw in Timelion. Attackers can construct a URL that when viewed
by a {osd} user, the {osd} process consumes large amounts of CPU and becomes unresponsive,
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7016[CVE-2020-7016].
+
You must upgrade to 7.8.1. If you are unable to upgrade, set `timelion.enabled` to `false` in your opensearch_dashboards.yml file to disable Timelion.

* In all {osd} versions, region map visualizations contain a stored XSS flaw. Attackers that can edit or create region map visualizations can obtain sensitive information
or perform destructive actions on behalf of {osd} users who view the region map visualization,
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-7017[CVE-2020-7017].
+
You must upgrade to 7.8.1. If you are unable to upgrade, set `xpack.maps.enabled`, `region_map.enabled`, and `tile_map.enabled` to `false` in opensearch_dashboards.yml to disable map visualizations.

[[security-update-7.7.0]]
=== Security updates
* In 7.7.0 to 7.6.2, the Upgrade Assistant contains a prototype pollution flaw. An authenticated attacker with
privileges to write to the {osd} index can insert data that could cause {osd} to execute arbitrary code. This
could lead to an attacker executing code with the permissions of the {osd} process on the host system, CVE-2020-7012.
+
By default, the Upgrade Assistant flaw is mitigated in all {osd} instances accessed through {opensearchs}.
+
For all other installations, you must upgrade to 7.7.0. If you are unable to upgrade, set `xpack.upgrade_assistant_enabled:false` in your opensearch_dashboards.yml file to disable the Upgrade Assistant.

* In 7.7.0 and earlier, TSVB contains a prototype pollution flaw. Authenticated attackers with privileges to create
TSVB visualizations can insert data that could cause {osd} to execute arbitrary code. This
could lead to an attacker executing code with the permissions of the {osd} process on the host system, CVE-2020-7013.
+
By default, the Upgrade Assistant flaw is mitigated in all {osd} instances accessed through {opensearchs}.

=== Security issues
In {osd} 7.6.0 and earlier, Node.js contains the following security issues:

* The TLS handling code for Node.js includes a Denial of Service (DoS) issue. Successful exploitation of the flaw could result in {osd} crashing. Refer to  https://www.elastic.co/community/security/, CVE-2019-15604.
+
There are no known workarounds for this issue.

* There are issues with how Node.js handles malformed HTTP headers. The malformed headers could result in an HTTP request smuggling attack when {osd} is running behind a proxy that is vulnerable to HTTP request smuggling attacks. Refer to https://www.elastic.co/community/security/, CVE-2019-15605 and CVE-2019-15606.
+
For instructions on how to mitigate HTTP request smuggling attacks, contact your proxy vendor.

Administrators running {osd} in an environment with untrusted users should upgrade to {osd} 7.6.1, which updates Node.js to 10.19.0.

=== Known issue

* When you use the default `dateFormat:tz: browser` setting, the timestamps appear in UTC instead of the local time of the user browser. To use the local time of the user browser, set `dateFormat:tz:` to the timezone of the user. {osd-issue}57457[#57457]
* The `server.customResponseHeaders` option prevents {osd} from starting if headers are set using a type other than string.
To fix this, convert your boolean and number headers to strings. For example, use `my-header: "true"` instead of `my-header: true`.

=== Regression
Watcher::
* Passes termOrder and hasTermsAgg properties to serializeThresholdWatch function {osd-pull}54391[#54391]
+
A regression was introduced into 7.5.0 that caused a particular configuration of Threshold Watches
to fail or erroneously trigger if they were created or edited in 7.5. If you've
created or edited a Threshold Watch with a "GROUPED OVER" condition set to `top` with {osd} 7.5.0,
you'll need to upgrade to a version of {osd} that contains this fix and recreate
these watches.
+
The easiest way to do this is to go to the edit screen of the
Threshold Watch in the UI and simply click the *Save* button. This will recreate the
watch with the proper configuration. No other changes to the watch will be necessary on your part.
