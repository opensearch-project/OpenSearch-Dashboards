## OpenAPI Specification For OpenSearch Dashboards API

### OpenAPI
The OpenAPI (https://swagger.io/specification/) Specification defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to the HTTP RESTful APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the functionalities provided by the service without having to read through the source code or lengthy documentation. When properly defined, a consumer of the API can understand and interact with the service with a minimal amount of efforts. The OpenAPI definition file can be in the YAML or JSON format.

When generated, OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API such as swagger UI, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.

### Starting Up the Swagger UI Locally
To start up the swagger UI locally for development or validation purposes, you can simply start a server in the directory where the index.html file is located. `npx serve` is a simple way to start a server.
