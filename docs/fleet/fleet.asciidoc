beta[]

{fleet} in {osd} enables you to add and manage integrations for popular
services and platforms, as well as manage {elastic-agent} installations in
standalone or {fleet} mode.

Standalone mode requires you to manually configure and manage the agent locally.

{fleet} mode offers several advantages:

* A central place to configure and monitor your {agent}s.
* An overview of the data ingest in your {opensearch} cluster.
* Multiple integrations to collect and transform data.
