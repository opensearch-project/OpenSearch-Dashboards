# Welcome to the Developer Guide

Welcome to our Developer Guide! This site is dedicated to providing comprehensive documentation to support developers using OpenSearch Dashboards. Here, you'll find a quick way to access all the readme's that exist within the OpenSearch Dashboards repo in an easy to find manner.

## About This Documentation

The documentation is dynamically generated using [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/). Docsify dynamically renders the Markdown files into HTML pages without the need for a build step. Docsify uses the documentation directly from the repository. The links in the sidebar are generated based on the folder structure of the repository. To update the links in the sidebar, run `yarn docs:generateDevDocs`.

## Starting Up the Doc Site Locally

To start up the documentation site locally for development or validation purposes, you can simply start a server in the root directory of the repository. `npx serve` is a simple way to start a server.
