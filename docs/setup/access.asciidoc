=== Log on to the web application

If you are using a self-managed deployment, you access {osd} through the web application on port 5601.

. Point your web browser to the machine where you are running {osd} and specify the port number. For example, `localhost:5601` or `http://YOURDOMAIN.com:5601`.

. To allow remote users to connect to {osd}, set the parameter `server.host` in opensearch_dashboards.yml to a non-loopback address.

. On the home page, click *{osd}*.

To make the {osd} page your landing page, click *Make this my landing page*.
