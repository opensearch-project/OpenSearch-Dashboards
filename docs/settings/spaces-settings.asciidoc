| `xpack.spaces.enabled`
  | Set to `true` (default) to enable Spaces in {osd}.

| `xpack.spaces.maxSpaces`
  | The maximum amount of Spaces that can be used with this instance of {osd}. Some operations
  in {osd} return all spaces using a single `_search` from {opensearch}, so this must be
  set lower than the `index.max_result_window` in {opensearch}.
  Defaults to `1000`.
