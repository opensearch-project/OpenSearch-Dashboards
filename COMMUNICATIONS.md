## Overview

The purpose of this document is to provide information regarding the communication channels for OpenSearch Dashboards. All communication is subject to the [OpenSearch Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you're interested in contributing to the project.

## Slack

The OpenSearch project has a public workspace on [Slack](https://opensearch.slack.com). See the [Getting Started guide]() for steps to register and setup the workspace.

Once registered, check out these channels for discussion of OpenSearch Dashboards topics:

- [#dashboards](https://opensearch.slack.com/archives/C01QENNTGUD)
- [#dashboards-ux](https://opensearch.slack.com/archives/C05389T9LJC)

## Forum

Slack conversations are not searchable outside the workspace. For this reason we encourage using the [OpenSearch Dashboards category](https://forum.opensearch.org/c/opensearch-dashboards/57) of the forum for technical support discussions or summarizing findings for the rest of the community.

## Developer Office Hours

### What it is

A recurring 1-hour virtual meeting for community developers to chat with [OpenSearch Dashboards project maintainers](MAINTAINERS.md). Priority will be given to topics that are signed-up in advance, but ad-hoc discussions are welcome in any remaining time.

While we'll always prioritize asynchronous communication, sometimes a community call is the most effective and efficient venue to share information and knowledge. Some reasons to sign up:

1. Review a proposal or technical design for a new feature in OpenSearch Dashboards or an OpenSearch Dashboards plugin
2. Learn more about how to build and extend OpenSearch Dashboards - which APIs, plugins, resources, and services are available to speed development
3. Discuss OpenSearch Dashboards roadmap and technical initiatives

Signing up isn't required to attend - all OpenSearch Dashboards contributors or interested developers are welcome as participants.

Bring your ideas and projects early, while you still have time and flexibility to make significant changes.

### When

Every other Thursday, 10AM-11AM PT.

### How to sign up

There will be a forum post for each iteration of the meeting, with pre-defined slots. To sign-up, simply reply in the forum thread with the following template:

* Topic: [a brief description of what you'd like to discuss]
* Requested by: [provide GitHub aliases of attendees]
* GitHub issues or PRs: [before signing up, make sure to create an issue, whether in the OpenSearch Dashboards repository or your own plugin repository]
* Time required [choose 15, 30, 45, or 60 minutes]
* Requested maintainer: [optional; provide GitHub alias of any particular maintainer you’d like to attend]

### FAQ

#### Will the meetings be recorded?

Yes, we plan to record each office hours session and post to our YouTube channel so the information can be more easily shared and referenced.

#### Will all maintainers attend?

Generally no, but there will always be at least one maintainer. We'll review the sign-ups ahead of time to make sure the right subject-matter experts will attend, depending on the topics.

#### What happens if there are no sign-ups for a particular session?

The session will still occur, and the maintainers will present a brief knowledge-sharing session or demo. We'll also hold ad-hoc discussions, but the session may end early.

#### Is it first come first serve or do we get to decide which topics we discuss in a session?

For sign-ups, it’s first-come first served, until we decide we need another method.

#### Will there also be meeting notes? or is the recording the only available transcript?

No. But we’ll also post the chat transcript and any slides shared (see https://forum.opensearch.org/t/opensearch-community-meeting-2023-0131/11892/5 as example)

#### How can I cancel or reschedule?

Just leave another forum reply, as early as possible so other folks have the opportunity to sign-up for the same spot.
