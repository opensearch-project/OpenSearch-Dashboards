* __[1.1] De-Couple Dashboards linux building process (#843)__

    [Anan](mailto:79961084+ananzh@users.noreply.github.com) - Tue, 5 Oct 2021 11:44:48 -0700
    
    When running yarn build --skip-os-packages it will build 4 tarballs for Dashboards (2x linux, 1x macOS, 1x windows) and takes 10+min to do so.
    
    In this PR, we break the building process to allow single linux to build. If run `yarn build-platform --linux-x64` only linux x64 tarball is created. Same for linux arm64 and darwin x64. You could run `yarn build-platform
    --linux-arm64` and `yarn build-platform darwin-x64`.

* __[1.1][Bug] Restore timeline legacy functions and filters__

    [Kawika Avilla](mailto:kavilla414@gmail.com) - Tue, 28 Sep 2021 12:38:11 -0700
        
    While renaming we changed values from legacy naming schema to OpenSearch
    Dashboards naming schema. However, after realizing we impacted backwards
    compatibility, we restored some of the
    &#34;under the hood&#34; components backed to legacy application to allow for seemless
    migration.
    
    However, upon attempting to restore Timeline to work with saved objects we
    neglected to restore the Timeline functions.
    
    Previously users could set kibana=false to ignore filters on the dashboards
    being applied to their Timeline visualizations. Now, if users tried to set it
    then it would fail because it didn&#39;t know what that function was.
    
    This commit fixes this issue by keeping the update since we do not want to
    impact people who have now updated their functions and re-added the legacy
    functions.
    
    In this commit, I also restore the aliases for &#34;elasticsearch&#34; and now included
    &#34;opensearch&#34; for Timeline queries.
    
    Finally, the key was incorrect for actually accessing the filter so it never
    applied the filters in the default state.

* __[Build] use saved legacy config for 1.x (#743)__

    [Kawika Avilla](mailto:kavilla414@gmail.com) - Tue, 31 Aug 2021 15:29:23 -0700
    
    
    An original update to enable taking settings from a valid legacy version and
    applying to current OpenSearch Dashboards was made here:
     https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/pull/485
    However, it explicitly checked for current version being 1.0.0, which is too strict because ideally all versions of 1.x is compatible.
    This makes the config check more relaxed and will taking settings from a legacy version if the current version is 1.x.

    Currently, unit test field_editor.test.tsx shows a console warning:
    
    `React.createElement: type is invalid -- expected a string
    (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components)
    but got: undefined. `

    This warning is because EuiCodeEditor is missing in the mock of elastic/eui, which causes undefined EuiCodeEditor in the test.

    Run unit test suite search_service.test.ts has a console error:
    ```
    UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: TypeError: Cannot read aggs property of undefined
    ```
    
    This is caused by a missing promise result check in the setup fun
    in search_service.ts. If the promise result is empty (or null/undefined), then any properties of the empty result is undefined. In our case,
    `aggs` in `if (value.search.aggs.shardDelay.enabled)` is undefined.
    In this PR, we fixed this issue by adding a value check in setup fun.

    Icon was not loading in the Visualize list because it was
    referencing a non-existant icon. Other parts of the code loads the icon correctly, so updated the icon to an existing
    icon.

* __[Test] Wrap FunComponent in unit test with IntlProvider (#654)__

    [Anan](mailto:79961084+ananzh@users.noreply.github.com) - Fri, 23 Jul 2021 09:01:00 -0700
       
    In the FunctionComponent unit tests, we see many console errors:
    `Could not find required intl object. &lt;IntlProvider&gt; needs to
    exist in the
    component ancestry. `
     This is because for some unit tests, we mount the FunctionComponent
    (with Enzyme&#39;s mount()) , which access to the react-intl context by
    
    FormattedMessage without their &lt;IntlProvider /&gt; parent wrapper.
    This PR solves 7 out of 8 unit tests with this issue by wrapping the &lt;IntlProvider /&gt; either through original enzyme_helper functions or a simple wrapper wrapWithIntl.

    [Kawika Avilla](mailto:kavilla414@gmail.com) - Tue, 13 Jul 2021 09:34:30 -0700  
    
    Removing the graceful failures for ARM64 snapshot testing and
    updating tests.
    Previously, snapshots for ARM64 were not available but now they are
    so this allows developers to run tests for that arch out of the box
    whereas before
    they had to set the snapshot manually.

* __[PURIFY] Remove certs and PKCS12 files temporarily (#616)__

    [Kawika Avilla](mailto:kavilla414@gmail.com) - Fri, 9 Jul 2021 11:42:06 -0700
    
    
    Removed the generated keys from Elastic. Since we did not own those
    and do not
    have the private key for the cert authority then it will
    be safer.
    This should not have any impact on runtime, might impact security
    related to x-pack with demo certs but none of the certs where
    for production. Otherwise,
    this is strictly for testing.
    
    To be clear, this can be emptied out because it is ONLY for demo
    and testing purposes. The demo security can be accomplished by
    using:
     
    https://github.com/opensearch-project/security/blob/main/tools/install_demo_configuration.sh
    
    Eventually we should take the certs from that file and copy those over but will just ignore the tests for now.
