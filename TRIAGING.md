The maintainers of the OpenSearch-Dashboards Repo seek to promote an inclusive and engaged community of contributors. In order to facilitate this, weekly triage meetings are open-to-all and attendance is encouraged for anyone who hopes to contribute, discuss an issue, or learn more about the project. To learn more about contributing visit the [Contributing](./CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation.

### Do I need to attend for my issue to be addressed/triaged?

Attendance is not required for your issue to be triaged or addressed. All new issues are triaged weekly.

### What happens if my issue does not get covered this time?

Each meeting we seek to  address all new issues. However, should we run out of time before your issue is discussed, you are always welcome to attend the next meeting or to follow up on the issue post itself.

### How do I join the Backlog & Triage meeting?

Meetings are hosted regularly at 1PM Eastern Time (10AM Pacific Time) and can be joined via the links posted on the [OpenSearch Meetup Group](https://www.meetup.com/opensearch/events/) list of events. The event will be titled `Triage Meeting - Dashboards`.

After joining the Zoom meeting, you can enable your video / voice to join the discussion.  If you do not have a webcam or microphone available, you can still join in via the text chat.

If you have an issue you'd like to bring forth please consider getting a link to the issue so it can be presented to everyone in the meeting.

### Is there an agenda for each week?

Meetings are 45 minutes and structured as follows:

1. Initial Gathering: As we gather, feel free to turn on video and engage in informal and open-to-all conversation.  After a bit a volunteer will share their screen and proceed with the agenda.
2. Announcements: If there are any announcements to be made they will happen at the start of the meeting.
3. Review of New Issues: The meetings always start with reviewing all untriaged [issues](https://github.com/search?q=label%3Auntriaged+is%3Aopen++repo%3Aopensearch-project%2FOpenSearch-Dashboards+&type=issues&ref=advsearch&s=created&o=desc).
4. Member Requests: Opportunity for any meeting member to ask for consideration of an issue or pull request.
6. Pull Request Discussion: Review the status of outstanding [pull requests](https://github.com/search?q=+is%3Aopen++repo%3Aopensearch-project%2FOpenSearch-Dashboards+&type=pullrequests&ref=advsearch).
7. Open Discussion: Allow for members of the meeting to surface any topics without issues filed or pull request created.


There is no specific ordering within each category.

If you have an issue you would like to discuss but do not have the ability to attend the entire meeting please attend when is best for you and signal that you have an issue to discuss when you arrive.

### Do I need to have already contributed to the project to attend a triage meeting?

No, all are welcome and encouraged to attend. Attending the Backlog & Triage meetings is a great way for a new contributor to learn about the project as well as explore different avenues of contribution.

### What if I have an issue that is almost a duplicate, should I open a new one to be triaged?

You can always open an [issue](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/issues/new/choose) including one that you think may be a duplicate. However, in cases where you believe there is an important distinction to be made between an existing issue and your newly created one, you are encouraged to attend the triaging meeting to explain.

### What if I have follow-up questions on an issue?

If you have an existing issue you would like to discuss, you can always comment on the issue itself. Alternatively, you are welcome to come to the triage meeting to discuss.

#### Is this where I should bring up potential security vulnerabilities?

Due to the sensitive nature of security vulnerabilities, please report all potential vulnerabilities directly by following the steps outlined on the [SECURITY.md](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/blob/main/SECURITY.md) document.
