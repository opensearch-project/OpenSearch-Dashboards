## Version Compatibility with OpenSearch

Ideally, you should be running OpenSearch and OpenSearch Dashboards with matching version numbers. If your OpenSearch has an older version number or a newer _major_ number than OpenSearch Dashboards, then OpenSearch Dashboards will fail to run. If OpenSearch has a newer minor or patch number than OpenSearch Dashboards, then the OpenSearch Dashboards Server will log a warning.

_Note: The version numbers below are only examples, meant to illustrate the relationships between different types of version numbers._
