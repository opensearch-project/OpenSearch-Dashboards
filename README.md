## Welcome

OpenSearch Dashboards is an open source search and analytics visualization. We aim to to be the best community-driven platform and provide all the contributors a great open source experience.

Feel free to take a look at what the community has been up to, and then head over to the [Project Board](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/projects) to track release targets, or jump in and [start opening issues](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/issues/new/choose) or [contributing](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch-Dashboards/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
